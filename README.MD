# End-to-End AI for Science

The End-to-End AI for Science Bootcamp provides a step-by-step overview of the fundamentals of deep neural networks, walks attendees through the hands-on experience of building and improving deep learning models using a framework that uses the fundamental laws of physics to model the behavior of complex systems, and enables attendees to visualize the physically accurate outputs of the trained model in near real-time.
